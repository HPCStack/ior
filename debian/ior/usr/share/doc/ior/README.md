# ior
IOR is designed to measure parallel file system I/O performance at both the POSIX and MPI-IO level.  "IOR" stands  "InterleavedOrRandom,‚Äù which has very little to do with how the program works currently.   This parallel program performs writes and reads to/from files under several sets of conditions and reports the resulting throughput rates.
